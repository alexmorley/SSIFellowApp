## 4 Golden Rules of Data Management
- Raw Data must never be touched.
<!-- raw data, i.e. what comes from your rig, notes you've taken on the day, images of sections etc. must all be a) backed-up and b) must be left raw. Don't cook sashimi -->


- Raw Data must never be touched.
- Have a plan.
<!-- you have to have a plan that details exactly what you will do with every bit of data you collect that needs to include - *What data* is going to be collected during the experiment? - Where is it going to be stored initially? - Where is it going to be backed-up. - When/How will it be curated so that you/others can use it for analysis.-->


- Raw Data must never be touched.
- Have a plan.
- Document *everything*.
<!-- At some point, someone is going to want to use either your data or your analysis scripts. And, (it's sad I know) at some point you're not going to still be working at the unit. Data or code without any comments or documentation is almost always pretty useless. If you want anything to have any chance of being re-used again (data or code) you have to include as much documentation as possible with it. -->
<!-- If you're as selfish as I am, I'll let you into a little secret, 95% of the time the person that's going to be using that documentation is you. -->


- Raw Data must never be touched.
- Have a plan.
- Document *everything*.
- Try not to re-invent the wheel.
<!-- you may be doing some incredibly original research but the likelyhood it someone else in the lab, or elsewhere, has already done something similar. Ask around *before* you start doing your experiments about how people stored there data, what format they kept their notes etc. If you can keep that standardised across the lab then even better. -->
