## Who am I?
### (proffessionally)


- Neuroscience DPhil Student at the University of Oxford
- Place to return as a Graduate Medical Student from Oct 2018



## My Research


- Aim: to work out how different regions in the brain co-ordinate to enable us seperate overlapping memories
- How: By recording signals from the brains of mice while they perform complex behavioural tasks


## Why is software important?
    - 100s TBs data per experiment
    - Preprocessing Steps
    - Machine Learning
    - Reproducibility
- But many neuroscientsts do not have computational or mathematical backgrounds. We're biologists!
